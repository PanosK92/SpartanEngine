/// applications retain full control to manage the memory used by the FidelityFX SDK, the
/// <c><i>scratchBuffer</i></c> and <c><i>scratchBufferSize</i></c> fields are
/// provided. A backend should provide a means of specifying how much scratch
/// memory is required for its internal implementation (e.g: via a function
/// or constant value). The application is then responsible for allocating that
/// memory and providing it when setting up the SDK backend. Backends provided
/// with the FidelityFX SDK do not perform dynamic memory allocations, and instead
