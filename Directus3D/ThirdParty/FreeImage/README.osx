Release Notes
--------------
This version of the library has been tested under OSX 10.3.9 PPC and OSX 10.4.8 Intel.

While the makefiles will make a .dylib and a .a, it is recommended to simply staticly link with the .a file.

FreeImage is now built as a Universal Binary and targets the 10.3.9 SDK for PPC and the 10.4u SDK for i386.
This means that you must have both of these SDKs installed and that you must be running on OSX 10.4+ to build FreeImage.
The library will run on 10.3 PPC, but probably not 10.2 or below anymore. wchar.h did not exist on 10.2.

FreeImage is now built with gcc 4.0 and will thus only run on 10.3.9 or above (some libraries may not exist on 10.3.8 and below).

The FreeImage makefile makes use of the gcc "-fvisibility=hidden" in order to avoid incompatibilities between 
internal third party libraries and the OS libraries. This feature is available with gcc 4 or greater.

Building the Library
--------------------
Makefile detects the environment by calling 'uname'. Assuming this reports 'Darwin' on your system, Makefile will automatically
defer commands to Makefile.osx. If this doesn't work, type 'make -f Makefile.osx' in place of just 'make'

The build process is as simple as this: 
1) Enter the FreeImage directory
2) Build the distribution: 
make
3) The libraries and header will be in the Dist directory when the build is finished

To install FreeImage in the /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include directories (not recommended):
make install

To clean all files produced during the build process:
make clean


Additional notes
----------------

Building on Mac OS X Leopard : 

Install the xcode dev tools from the Leopard disk. 
When installing the dev tools make sure to have installed 10.3.9 SDK (it's not selected by default).
