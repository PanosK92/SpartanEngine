# Pull Request (PR) Guidelines
- Functionality: Ensure your PR is functional. While it can be incomplete, the code it introduces should be operational.
- Collaboration restrictions: Other contributors generally can't modify your PR directly. Hence, non-functional PRs can obstruct the project's progress.
- Iterative improvements: It's okay for your PR to be a part of a larger task. Incremental, functional changes are encouraged.
- Focus: Keep PRs focused on one issue or change. Avoid touching unrelated aspects of the engine, as it makes review harder and increases merge conflicts.
- Communication: If you're looking for collaboration on your PR, communicate this in your PR description or through our Discord community.
