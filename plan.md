# The Plan

[![The Inspiration](https://img.youtube.com/vi/R3QvniaZ5qM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/R3QvniaZ5qM?t=53)

There's a fan-made CGI video of cars racing through the Need for Speed Underground 2 city that has captured the imagination of millions. It's cinematic, atmospheric, and evokes a feeling that's hard to put into words - the glow of neon signs reflecting off wet asphalt, the roar of tuned engines echoing through tunnels, the energy of a city that never sleeps.

**We're going to capture that feeling - in real-time.**

Not a pre-rendered video. Not a cutscene. A living, breathing city running at 60fps on Spartan Engine - inspired by that atmosphere, built with our own vision. Neon reflections on wet streets. The rumble of tuned engines. A city that feels alive. And you can actually drive through it, feel the physics, and experience it firsthand.

## Why This Matters

### 1. A Promotional Showcase

When someone asks "What can Spartan Engine do?", we'll have an answer that speaks for itself. A video trailer that demonstrates path tracing, volumetric fog, car physics, and massive environments - all running in real-time. This isn't a tech demo with spinning cubes. This is something people *want* to experience.

### 2. Forcing the Engine to Mature

Ambition drives progress. By committing to a specific, demanding goal, we'll discover exactly what's missing, what's broken, and what needs polish. The gaps between "research project" and "game-ready engine" will become impossible to ignore - and we'll close them one by one.

### 3. A Functional Foundation

When we reach this goal, we won't just have a video. We'll have a functional city environment with:
- Driveable vehicles with realistic physics
- Dynamic lighting and weather
- Streaming and performance optimizations
- All the systems needed to make an actual game

It might not be a game yet, but it's *everything you need* to make one.

## The Vision as a Guide

Here's what makes this approach powerful: once you have this vision in your head, you'll naturally understand what needs to be done.

Watch the video. Look at the engine. The delta between the two is your roadmap.

- The rain effects aren't good enough? Now you know.
- The city feels empty? Now you know.
- The lighting doesn't capture that atmosphere? Now you know.
- The car sounds don't match the visuals? Now you know.

You don't need someone to assign you tasks. The vision tells you what's missing. Your taste tells you what's not good enough. Your skills tell you what you can fix.

## What We Already Have

Spartan isn't starting from zero:

- **Path tracing and real-time GI** - the lighting foundation is there
- **Advanced car physics** - Pacejka tires, thermal models, telemetry, the works
- **Massive environments** - 256 million grass blades across 64 km², thousands of trees
- **Modern rendering** - bindless Vulkan, variable rate shading, FSR/XeSS upscaling
- **The community** - 600+ members, industry professionals, and growing momentum

The pieces exist. Now we assemble them into something that moves people.

## What's Next

This is an MVP - a minimum viable proof that Spartan can deliver something real, something that moves people. But reaching this milestone isn't just about the tech. It's a threshold.

A functional demo at this level attracts attention. Investors. Studios. Opportunities we can't predict yet. The moment you have something tangible that people can see, feel, and believe in - doors open. What starts as a community project can transform into something far bigger.

When we get there - and we will - we'll have proven something. We'll have the knowledge, the codebase, the community, and the momentum to revisit this plan and aim for the stars.

First, we build the city.

Then, we see how far we can go.

*If this resonates with you, pick up something and start building. The vision is shared. The work is open. Let's make it real.*
